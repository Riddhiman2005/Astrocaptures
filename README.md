Welcome 
Welcome to my astrocaptures repository! Here, you will find some of my favorite shots of the night sky. I'm an amateur astrophotographer who loves capturing the beauty and wonder of the universe. One of the most appealing aspects of sky observation is the opportunity to explore the beauties and mysteries of the dark unknown universe from the comfort of your own backyard or roof. 
I underwent a training session of Astrophotography and Sky Observation from IAYC (International Astronomical Youth Camp). 
If you have a photo of the night sky that you would like to share, please feel free to contribute! Simply fork this repository, add your photo to the Gallery section, and submit a pull request.
